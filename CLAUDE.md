# Arcana Ludus — Project CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
- **Engine:** Godot 4 (GDScript)
- **Genre:** 2D Roguelike Deckbuilder (score-chasing, Balatro-inspired)
- **Theme:** Real tarot mechanics gamified — spreads, reversed cards, elemental chains, Veil mechanic
- **Architecture:** Component-based, signal-driven, data-driven definitions
- **Native Language:** English (code, assets, UI)
- **Target Price:** $12.99–$14.99
- **Art:** Classic Rider-Waite-Smith public domain tarot (1909)
- **Repo:** github.com/BYGGOLDENSTONE/arcana-ludus

## Current Phase
- **Phase:** Phase 1 (Foundation) complete → Ready for Phase 2 (Core Mechanics)
- **Target:** Playable Steam Demo (Act I, full juice)
- **Next Step:** Begin Phase 2 — spread system, card placement, match detection, basic scoring engine

## Development Rules

### Code Rules
- **Language:** GDScript only (no C#, no GDExtension)
- **Architecture:** Component-based nodes. Each system is a reusable component
- **Signals:** Use EventBus (autoload) for cross-system communication. Direct signals for parent-child
- **Data-driven:** Cards, spreads, talismans, querents defined as Resource files or JSON. No hardcoded game data
- **Naming:** snake_case for files/variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/nodes, UPPER_CASE for constants
- **Comments:** English only. Only where logic isn't self-evident

### Art Rules
- **Card images:** Use downloaded RWS JPGs from `assets/cards/original/` (public domain 1909 art)
- **All other visuals:** Generate as SVG — card frames, card backs, UI elements, icons, talisman icons, spread backgrounds, Veil eye, particles
- **Do NOT use the name "Rider-Waite"** — it's trademarked. Use "classic tarot" or the game's own deck name
- **Color palette:** Deep purples, midnight blues, gold accents, candlelight warmth
- **Typography:** Serif for card names (mystical), sans-serif for numbers/UI (readability)

### Design Rules
- **Tarot authenticity first:** Never break real tarot rules. Gamification layers ON TOP
- **Tarot knowledge = intuitive advantage:** Card-position meaning matches, suit associations, reversed logic — all mirror real tarot
- **Balatro-level juice:** Every scoring event needs visual weight — screen shake, particles, number animations, sound
- **Dual audience:** Tarot enthusiasts AND deckbuilder fans are both first-class citizens
- **Teach through play:** Non-tarot players learn tarot by playing. Grimoire, tooltips, match preview glow

### Git Rules
- Commit and push after completing each phase
- Meaningful commit messages in English
- No force push to main

## Key Design Pillars
1. **Authentic Tarot** — Real tarot rules are foundation. Gamification on top, never contradicts
2. **Score-Chase Dopamine** — Balatro-level visual feedback. Numbers cascade, multipliers explode
3. **Meaningful Choices** — Every card placement is a strategic decision
4. **Dual Audience** — Tarot enthusiasts feel intuitive mastery + deckbuilder fans feel strategic depth
5. **Run Variety** — Every run feels different through querents, talismans, deck evolution, Veil

## Documents
- `docs/GDD.md` — Full Game Design Document (all mechanics, cards, systems)
- `docs/DEMO_PLAN.md` — 8-phase demo development roadmap

## Architecture

### Autoload Singletons (7)
- `GameManager` — run state, current act/querent, lives
- `DeckManager` — player deck, draw pile, discard, hand
- `ScoreManager` — scoring engine, combo detection
- `VeilManager` — Veil counter, tier tracking
- `DataLoader` — loads card/spread/talisman definitions
- `AudioManager` — SFX and music bus management
- `EventBus` — global signal bus for cross-component communication
